# Visual Profiler

The VisualProfiler provides a drop in, single file, solution for viewing your Windows Mixed Reality Unity application's frame rate and memory usage.

Missed frames are displayed over time to visually find problem areas. Memory is reported as current, peak and max usage in a bar graph.

The Visual Profiler is targeted towards profiling 3D UWP Unity applications, and has been verified to work on the following platforms:

- Microsoft HoloLens & HoloLens 2
- Microsoft Immersive headsets (IHMD)
- Steam VR (HTC Vive / Oculus Rift)
- OpenXR platforms

## Installation

Clone, or download, VisualProfiler.cs and place it anywhere within the Assets folder of your Unity project.

Next, add the VisualProfiler component to any GameObject in the Unity scene you wish to profile. The profiler is initially active and visible (toggle-able via the IsVisible property), but can be toggled via the enabled/disable voice commands keywords.

NOTE: For improved rendering performance you can optionally include the "Hidden/Instanced-Colored" shader in your project along with the VisualProfiler.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to add the microphone capability to your app if you plan on using the enable/disable keywords, in Unity under Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Settings for Windows Store -> Publishing Settings -> Capabilities or in your Visual Studio Package.appxmanifest capabilities.

## Usage

When using the profiler look for "missed frames" which appear as orange bars. Missed frames indicate your application is not hitting its target frame rate and may need optimization work.

One should also keep an eye on the bottom memory bar to insure memory usage isn't rapidly changing or approaching the application's memory limit.

The profiler UI (such as anchoring, scale, follow behavior and UI color) can also be tweaked in the component inspector.
